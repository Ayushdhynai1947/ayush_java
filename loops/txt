loop 
========================
it makes coding simple /easy
you will write command once and that command will run n number 
of times
* n can be finite a well as infinite
* ypu will have to define a loop
* you can define a loop one if the following keyword
* you can define loop by using one of the following 
   keyword
1 for 
2 while
3 do and while


these loops are known as loop constructs

1) when define loops using for?
 when n is finite  and fixed 

2) when define loops using while?
 when n is finite or infinite 

3) when define loops using do and while?
 the only defrence between do while is one time body 
    will  executed then condition  is checked



Syntex of for loops
=========================================
for (int ctr =0;ctr<10;ctr++){
    // command 
}
